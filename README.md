# RESTful Service & React Client

## Overview
This project is a full-stack application consisting of a RESTful API built with Node.js and Express, paired with a React frontend client.

The backend exposes structured CRUD endpoints, while the frontend consumes API responses and renders dynamic UI components.

The project demonstrates request handling, route structuring, data validation, and client-server interaction.
